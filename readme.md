<p class="para">Hi, My name is Ahmed Hesham and this is my apply what I learned in this course with the instructor</p>

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this PugJS content.

**I studied this course to make it easier with HTML and divide it into components instead of frameworks (I am absolutly using frameworks but just for big project) and convert PugJs to HTML using GulpJS, it was a very interesting trip and I learned a lot from Eng.Ali Elrayes and I wish for him a great success.**
